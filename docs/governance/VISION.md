## Philosophy

Mamet AI is not a chatbot, not an AI coding tool, and not only RAG.

Mamet AI is a personal AI Operating System where identity, knowledge, workflows, and evolution remain under the owner's control.

The LLM is not Mamet AI's identity. The LLM is only a replaceable reasoning engine.

The primary asset of Mamet AI is not the model. The primary asset is continuously growing knowledge.

## Full Custom Control

Owned by Mamet AI:

- source code
- project knowledge
- project memory
- user memory
- workflows
- rules
- architecture
- RAG
- decision history
- bug history
- data

Borrowed from vendors:

- LLMs
- hosting
- database services
- IDEs

Vendor services are replaceable. Mamet AI identity remains internal.

## Long Term Vision

One application. One identity. Many capabilities.

The user interacts with Mamet AI. Capabilities are internal modes, not separate identities.

## Capability Map

### Assistant

The daily work assistant. It uses User Memory and Knowledge RAG.

### MametLite

The fast and low-cost mode. It focuses on lightweight reasoning, retrieval, and simple work.

### Engineer

The internal engineer for Mamet AI. It must understand source code, architecture, database, workflow, agents, deployment, testing, and bug history.

Engineer is the official workshop for Mamet AI.

## Shared Services

### User Memory

Stores preferences, habits, personal workflow, and user-specific context.

### Knowledge RAG

Stores external knowledge such as documents, regulations, notes, references, and archives.

### Project Memory

Project Memory is the main asset for Engineer. It is not source code. It is the memory of the project.

It stores philosophy, architecture, workflow, ADRs, coding rules, folder structure, APIs, database schema, dependencies, feature history, bug history, root causes, lessons learned, release notes, engineer notes, and deployment notes.

## Engineer Lifecycle

1. Understand Project Memory
2. Understand repository
3. Understand architecture
4. Analyze bugs
5. Propose solutions
6. Create patches
7. Run tests
8. Get user approval when needed
9. Update Project Memory

No experience should disappear. Bugs, analysis, patches, testing, and lessons learned must become Project Memory.

## Knowledge Status

Knowledge should move through explicit states:

- Hypothesis
- In Progress
- Verified
- Deprecated
- Rejected
